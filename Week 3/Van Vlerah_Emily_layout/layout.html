	        	<p>Geckos are lizards belonging to the infraorder Gekkota, found in warm climates throughout the world. They range from 1.6 to 60 cm. 
	        	Most geckos cannot blink, but they often lick their eyes to keep them clean and moist. 
	        	They have a fixed lens within each iris that enlarges in darkness.
	        	All geckos shed their skin at fairly regular intervals, with species differing in timing and method. 
	        	Leopard geckos will shed at about two- to four-week intervals. The presence of moisture aids in the shedding. 
	        	When shedding begins, the gecko will speed the process by detaching the loose skin from its body and eating it.
	        	Gecko toes have special adaptations that allow them to adhere to most surfaces without the use of liquids or surface tension. 
	        	About 60% of gecko species have adhesive toe pads; such pads have been gained and lost repeatedly over the course of gecko evolution.
	        	Geckos are polyphyodonts and able to replace each of their 100 teeth every 3 to 4 months. 
	        	Next to the full grown tooth there is a small replacement tooth developing from the odontogenic stem cell in the dental lamina.</p>
	        	<h2 a id="taxonomy">Taxonomy and Classification</h2>
