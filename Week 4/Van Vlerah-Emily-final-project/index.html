            	<h1 id="about_makers">About Creators of Borderlands</h1>
	        	<p>Gearbox Software was founded on <em>February 16, 1999</em> by five members of the content team from the defunct developer Rebel Boat Rocker: Randy Pitchford, Brian Martel, Stephen Bahl, Landon Montgomery, and Rob Heironimus. Before Rebel Boat Rocker, Pitchford and Martel previously worked together at 3D Realms, and Montgomery previously worked at Bethesda Softworks.

				<br/><br/>They started with developing expansions to Valve Software's Half-Life. 
				Porting Half-Life to console platforms (each with new game content) followed, building the company's experience in console game-making, in addition to enhancing and building upon the successful Counter-Strike branch of the Half-Life franchise. 
				Prior to Half-Life 2, they had developed or helped develop every Half-Life expansion game or port, including Opposing Force, Blue Shift, Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, Half-Life for the Sony PlayStation 2 (including Half-Life Decay), and Half-Life for the Sega Dreamcast (including Blue Shift). 
				Branching out to other publishers, they pursued additional port work, each game being released with additional content, but this time from console to PC. These projects included their first non-first-person shooter, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3, and Halo: Combat Evolved, forging new publisher relationships with Activision and Microsoft Game Studios respectively. 
				Additional new development, in the form of a PC game in the James Bond franchise (James Bond 007: Nightfire) for Electronic Arts, also occurred during the company's initial 5-year period.

				<br/><br/>In 2005, they launched an original property of their creation, Brothers in Arms, with the release of Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30 on the Xbox, PC and PlayStation 2. 
				Later that year a sequel, Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood, was launched. In 2008 Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway was released.

				<br/><br/>2007 brought announcements of new projects based on licensed film intellectual properties, including the crime drama Heat and the science-fiction classic Aliens.
				 In the September 2007 issue of Game Informer, a new game franchise was revealed, the sci-fi shooter Borderlands, after which Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford mentioned in an online interview that development on the Heat game had not yet begun, as the planned development partner for the project had gone under.
				  This was followed by an announcement by Sega that they would be helming a new version of rhythm game Samba de Amigo for the Wii, a departure from their signature first-person shooter titles.</p>

	        	<p>Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is an upcoming first-person shooter video game being developed by 2K Australia and to be published by 2K Games. 
	        	It is the third game in the Borderlands series, and a prequel to the 2012 game Borderlands 2. It is expected to be released for Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in late-2014. 
	        	The rumored existence of the game was first reported on <em>April 7, 2014</em>, and it was officially announced two days later on <em>April 9, 2014</em>.
	        	<br /><br />Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel combines <abbr title="First-person shooter">FPS</abbr> gameplay with mechanics common to role-playing video games (such as quests, character building and randomly generated <q>loot</q>), and collaborative multiplayer campaign gameplay. 
	        	Similarly to previous Borderlands titles, the game will focus on four playable protagonistsâ€”all of whom were featured as <abbr title="Non-player character">NPCs</abbr> in previous Borderlands games, working as henchmen for Handsome Jack, the antagonist of Borderlands 2. The plot will follow Handsome Jack's descent into villainy, focusing on his escape and capture of the Hyperion company's moonbase. 
	        	The game will expand upon the engine and gameplay of Borderlands 2 and introduce new gameplay mechanics, including anti-gravity, freeze weapons, and oxygen tanks which can be used to navigate environments and perform special attacks.</p>
